# need to get more data about animals when only have 1 in result set
# more test cases required.
# input validation. better implementation when adding new animals.
# remove bad characters from input
# research neural networks in node.js
# consider an "unknown"/"I don't know"/"sometimes" answer besides Yes/no
# startup check to ensure all animals are unique
# rethink callbacks
# decide if remove addanimal and add question pages from main index page.
# somehow list existing animals.
# report incorrect postive/negative values for an animal?
